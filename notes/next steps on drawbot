power over rails test
	annodized layer insullates electricity


speed tests
	horizontal
		max stable speed 100
		200 was farily stable
		400 major skipped steps

	vertical
		max stable speed 100
		200 was farily stable
		400 major skipped steps
		shakes in moderate speeds

	45 down left
		runs smooth
		looks good at speeds 50 through 250
		wobbles a higher speeds

	1/3 slope 
		runs about as smooth as 45, a little more wobbles, but looks like hardware rigidity rather than software issue

change stepper timing to get smoother diaginal lines test

acceleration test
	used the serial buffer to buffer commands
	sent accellerated lines for square
	helped with wobble significantly with same top speed.

max speed test

new shield?
	add stop switches

new laser horizontal and vertical cars
shaft colar for better mate
